Notebooks:

1. backazimuth.ipynb

Purpose: Calculate back azimuth (BAZ) from horizontal rotation rate data.
Key Function: calculate_baz_horiz()
Output: Time vector, BAZ vector, and visualizations.

2. plot events in time.ipynb

Purpose: Visualize seismic events over time.
Processes: Reads event data, calculates P-S phase differences, and plots event occurrences.

3.waveform_visualisation_allday.ipynb

Purpose: Visualize daily seismic waveforms.
Output: Continuous waveform plots for an entire day.

4.waveform_visualisation_combined.ipynb

Purpose: Combine and visualize multiple waveform datasets.
Output: Overlaid waveform plots for comparison.

5.waveforms_visualisation.ipynb

Purpose: Visualize and analyze seismic waveforms.
Output: Detailed waveform plots with analysis.
